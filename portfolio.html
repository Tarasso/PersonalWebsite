    <h3>A hackathon project to filter university email spam in accordance with you preferences, <a href="https://github.com/ninjaboyangel/BTHOspam" target="_blank" class="h3">source code</a></h3> 
    
    <p>This project was born from one of Texas A&M's hackathon, HowdyHack 2019, winning the Best Aggie Hack. As a team of four, in 24 hours we produced a python based GUI that generated XML files based on a user's preferences. This file would then be uploaded to Gmail to filter both existing and incoming emails. BTHOspam was developed throughout Fall of 2019 as an Aggie Coding Club project with goals of creating a cloud based web app, but was cut short due Corona virus.</p>

    <h3>A project from my programming languages course that uses Merkle trees to detect discrepancies between files</h3>
    <p>Merkle trees are a data structures that takes advantage of a hierarchical hashing system that allows for instant comparison of files and offers an efficient method to correct updates. This project was completed by my partner and myself using Java and simulates the use of Merkle trees in a business setting that tracks sales reports.</p>
