            <p class="light-color">A hackathon project to filter university email spam in accordance with you preferences</p>
            <p class="justify">This project was born from one of Texas A&M's hackathon, HowdyHack 2019, winning the Best Aggie Hack. As a team of four, in 24 hours we produced a python based GUI that generated XML files based on a user's preferences. This file would then be uploaded to Gmail to filter both existing and incoming emails. BTHOspam was developed throughout Fall of 2019 as an Aggie Coding Club project with goals of creating a cloud based web app, but was cut short due Corona virus.</p>

            <p class="light-color">A project from my programming languages course that uses Merkle trees to detect discrepancies between files</p>
            <p class="justify">Merkle trees are a data structures that takes advantage of a hierarchical hashing system that allows for instant comparison of files and offers an efficient method to correct updates. This project was completed by my partner and myself using Java and simulates the use of Merkle trees in a business setting that tracks sales reports.</p>

            <p class="light-color">A collection of moderately sized C++ projects centered around utilizing crucial data structures and algorithms</p>
            <p class="justify">This collection of projects covers a wide variety of data structures in addition to different search and sorting algorithms. Project 0 is a simple implementation of vectors in the context of an Amazon delivery truck. Project 1 utilizes templated, nested linked lists and arrays. Project 2 builds commonly used fuctionality on top of a basic binary search tree. Project 3 is a personal favorite in which I implemented a splay tree to simulate word autocompletion by suggesting frequently used words that begin with given substring. Finally, project 4 uses min and max heaps to test common and uncommon passwords to brute force hack into a system. </p>

            <p class="light-color">A program that offers statistical and biological insight of various DNA sequences from my introductory C++ course</p>
            <p class="justify">This program supports .fasta and .prot_table file formats and calculates interesting benchmarks such as number of base pairs, GC content percentage, longest homopolymer, and the overall coding fraction percentage. Additionally, basic statistics are generated on intergenic regions. Finally, additional gene parameters can be specified to see a gene's base pair and amino acid breakdown.</p>
