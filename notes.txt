Howdy!
My name is kyle?

Student | Developer | Philomath


I am currently studying computer science and applied mathematics at Texas A&M University and I am passionate about numerical programming, back-end development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. In my free time I enjoy exploring in my hobbies of cooking and photography.

about me

I am in my sophomore year at Texas A&M and plan to graduate spring of 2023 in a double major in computer science and applied mathematics (BS) with minors in cybersecurity and statistics. I truly love to learn and find the intersection of these subjects quite intriguing.

I truly value teamwork and prefer to work in an environment that facilitates constant communication and cross-functional involvement. I seek to listen to ideas, make compromises, and follow through on design and development efforts.

My passions revolve around experimenting and exploring in cooking and photography. Especially with food, I love to experiment with new dishes and cook with what I have available as a way to spend time with others. Additionally, photography is a creative outlet in which I enjoy exploring the world through the viewpoint of my camera. In the same vein, my newest quarantine hobbies have been making sourdough bread and learning more about making artisan coffee.

This picture is from my first virtual day of my internship with Chevron!

Work experience
Chevron: Software Engineering Intern
Summer 2021
Coming soonâ€¦

Chevron: Software Engineering Intern
Summer 2020
I worked as a software engineering intern within Chevron's subsurface platform team where I helped contribute to an ongoing project of migrating internal workflows and mass data storage to the Azure cloud in compliance with and contributing to the Open Subsurface Data Universe (OSDU). I worked with a variety of tools including C#, Angular, PowerBI, and various Azure features to contribute to the full stack development.



British Petroleum: Project Intern
August 2018
I had the opportunity to shadow BP's High Performance Computing Team and accept a challenge to code solutions to 3 real problems faced by BP while trying to collect data in the ocean. I wrote programs to sort data, predict resources needed, and increase efficiency in both Java and Python. These programs were successfully presented to a BP engineer for feedback.

Baker Hughes: Observational Internship
June 2017
This internship provided insight into the oilfield and energy industry. This experience allowed me to tour research and design facilities throughout Houston that were testing cutting edge technology for drilling and extracting oil such as fluid flow simulations and 3D printing with metal welding. In addition, I was allowed to see some of the same technology beta tested on an experimental drilling rig in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

BTHOspam
A hackathon project to filter university email spam in accordance with you preferences.
This project was born from one of Texas A&M's hackathon, HowdyHack 2019, winning the Best Aggie Hack. As a team of four, in 24 hours we produced a python based GUI that generated XML files based on a user's preferences. This file would then be uploaded to Gmail to filter both existing and incoming emails. BTHOspam was developed throughout Fall of 2019 as an Aggie Coding Club project with goals of creating a cloud based web app, but was cut short due Corona virus.


File Version Comparator
A project from my programming languages course that uses Merkle trees to detect discrepancies between files.
Merkle trees are a data structures that takes advantage of a hierarchical hashing system that allows for instant comparison of files and offers an efficient method to correct updates. This project was completed by my partner and myself using Java and simulates the use of Merkle trees in a business setting that tracks sales reports.

DS&A Practice
A collection of moderately sized C++ projects centered around utilizing crucial data structures and algorithms.
-	Project0: vector practice
-	Project1: linked lists, templates, arrays
-	Project2: augmented binary search tree
-	Project3: splay trees (a personal favorite that simulates word autocompletion by suggesting frequently used words that begin with given substring)
-	Project4: min and max heaps

Genomics Analyzer 
A program that offers statistical and biological insight of various DNA sequences from my introductory C++ course
-	Supports .fasta and .prot_table file formats
-	Counts base pairs
-	Calculates GC content
-	Longest homopolymer
-	Statistics on genes and intergenic regions
-	Coding fraction percentage
-	Gene base pair and amino acid breakdown 


Command Line Utilities 
A collection of useful commands built in my introductory C++ course.
-	Calendar tool
-	Custom grep
-	Estimating Pi
-	Line, word, and character count
-	Making change in a vending machine
-	Add, multiply, differentiate, and solve basic polynomials

Service

Impact Retreat
From camper to counselor to co-chair
Impact Retreat is a 4-day retreat designed to connect incoming freshmen and transfer students to churches and ministries that will provide lasting community on the foundation of Jesus Christ and the Gospel. As someone who was so affected by this program, I could not resist returning as a counselor. In that position I trained for a semester on listening, guiding, and facilitating conversations and put this into practice come retreat with a group of freshmen. Now I serve as a co-chair with my partner with the responsibilities of selecting and choosing ten counselors for our camp to train and prepare for retreat in the fall.

Memorial Student Center Freshman in Service and Hosting
Member
MSC FISH is a selective freshmen leadership organization focused on providing students leadership opportunities by engaging in community service and program development on campus and within the community. During my time in FISH, I participated in weekly service events such as playing bingo at a local community center and worked to plan one of our big events: Kyle Field Day- the largest freshmen-led service event held at Texas A&M that invites students and community members alike to "share their service."
