Howdy!
My name is kyle?
I am a sophomore at Texas A&M University seeking a dual major in computer science and applied mathematics. I am a creative problem solver and enjoy working with others to create solutions to problems we face as students. Currently, 
I am interning with Chevron to implement a cloud based solution to subsurface data storing and querying under OSDU guidelines. I am always seeking connections in the computer science field to further develop and refine my technical and business skills.

Work experience
Chevron: Software Engineering Intern
Summer 2021
Coming soon…

Chevron: Software Engineering Intern
Summer 2020
I currently work as a software engineering intern within Chevron's subsurface platform team where I am helping contribute to an ongoing project of migrating internal workflows and mass data storage to the Azure cloud in compliance with and contributing to the Open Subsurface Data Universe (OSDU). I am working with a variety of tools including C#, Angular, PowerBI, and various Azure features to contribute to the full stack development.
•	Development of cloud based data manager of subsurface data
•	Contributed code in front end, back end, and data analytics aspects
•	Also created PowerBI report to visualize data that is in the service
•	Final products will be available to Chevron subsurface analysts
•	Tools include Azure stack, C#, Angular, PowerBI, Agile, and more


British Petroleum: Project Intern
August 2018
I had the opportunity to shadow BP's High Performance Computing Team and accept a challenge to code solutions to 3 real problems faced by BP while trying to collect data in the ocean. I wrote programs to sort data, predict resources needed, and increase efficiency in both Java and Python. These programs were successfully presented to a BP engineer for feedback.

Baker Hughes: Observational Internship
June 2017
This internship provided insight into the oilfield and energy industry. This experience allowed me to tour research and design facilities throughout Houston that were testing cutting edge technology for drilling and extracting oil such as fluid flow simulations and 3D printing with metal welding. In addition, I was allowed to see some of the same technology beta tested on an experimental drilling rig in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

projects
BTHOspam
Hackathon plus continued development
Served as a co-manager helping to lead the development of a project called BTHOspam. This project was born from one of Texas A&M's hackathon, HowdyHack, winning the Best Aggie Hack. As a team of four, in 24 hours we produced a python based GUI that generated XML files based on a user's preferences. This file would then be uploaded to Gmail to filter both existing and incoming emails. BTHOspam was developed throughout Fall of 2019 as an Aggie Coding Club project with goals of creating a cloud based web app, but was cut short due Corona virus.
•	Awarded Best Aggie Hack at TAMU hackathon
•	Python GUI to write personalized XML files to filter university mass email spam 
•	Led 10 person team to finish out development for public release
•	Project has been paused since COVID-19
